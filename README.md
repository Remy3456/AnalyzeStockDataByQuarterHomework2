## Instructions

First create a VBA code Sub AnalyzeStockDataByQuarter():

Variable Initialization:

Initializes variables to store ticker symbols, stock prices (open, close), volumes, and percentage changes.
Initializes variables to track the greatest increase, greatest decrease, and highest total volume across tickers.
Loop Through Worksheets:

Iterates through all worksheets in the workbook to analyze stock data and add Headers.

Adds headers in specific columns (I to L and O to Q) for outputting quarterly stock data, including ticker, quarterly change, percent change, and total stock volume.
Identify Last Row:

Finds the last row of data for the worksheet to know where to stop the analysis.
Process Stock Data:

Loops through the stock data for each ticker:
Converts date from string to Date format.
Accumulates total volume for the same ticker.
If a new ticker is detected, calculates the price change, percent change, and outputs the data to the worksheet.
Tracks the greatest percentage increase, decrease, and total volume.
Resets the variables for each new ticker or quarter.


For each quarter outputs:  Ticker symbol, Price change , Percent change (formatted as a percentage), Total stock volume.
Also checks for the highest percentage increase, decrease, and total volume, and updates tracking variables.

Conditional Formatting: Applies conditional formatting to the percent change column:
Green for positive numbers (profits) and Red for negative numbers (losses).
Greatest Values Summary:

After processing all the rows, the code outputs: The ticker with the greatest percentage increase and decrease. The ticker with the highest total volume.

ConvertToDate Function:
Converts dates in MM/DD/YYYY format into actual Excel Date format for further analysis.
